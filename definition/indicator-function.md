## Definition of _Indicator Function_

#### Setup

- $$X$$ denote the universal set,
- $$x$$ denote any element in $$X$$,
- $$A$$ denote any subset of $$X$$,
- $$1$$ denote the real number 1,
- 

#### Definition

The **indicator function of the set $$A$$** is defined as

$$
1_A (x) = 
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if $x \in A$},
\\
0 & \text{if $x \notin A$}.
\end{cases}
$$

#### Usage

Indicator functions are used to talk about the relations between subsets.
